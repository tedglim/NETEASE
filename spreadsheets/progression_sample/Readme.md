# Base Progression Snapshot
An example structure for how to set up and tune in-game progression for an imaginary simulation (SLG) game. </br>
For context, in most SLG games, players will develop a headquarters which will cap the levels of all other buildings in your city. This spreadsheet shows how to determine the cost and amount of time it will take to upgrade the headquarters per level and determine the benefits gained from leveling up.</br>
The upgrade costs are in dollar amount and then converted into in-game resources on another spreadsheet. </br></br>
